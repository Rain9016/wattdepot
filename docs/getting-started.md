# WattDepot Getting Started Guide

This guide steps you through installing and configuring the WattDepot server.

The first step is to decide how you are going to use WattDepot:

* If you are planning on using WattDepot to store your electricity and other associated 
environmental data, but do no development on WattDepot. Then there are two server installation 
options available, local deployment or [Heroku](http://www.heroku.com) deployment.

  * If you choose local deployment ensure that your computer meets the [prerequisites](http://wattdepot.viewdocs.io/wattdepot/installationguide/prerequisites). Then follow the [local installation guide](http://wattdepot.viewdocs.io/wattdepot/installationguide/installation).
