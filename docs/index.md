# Welcome to WattDepot

## What it does

WattDepot is an open source software system that:
* Collects electricity and/or other associated environmental data (temperature, humidity, lighting) from meters;
* Stores this data in a back-end repository;
* Provides useful querying and retrieval functions for visualization or integration with other applications.

See the [Getting Started Guide](http://wattdepot.viewdocs.io/wattdepot/getting-started) for a quick tutorial on setting up WattDepot for your organization.

## Who we are

Its development has been led by members of the [Collaborative Software Development Laboratory](http://csdl.ics.hawaii.edu) in the [Department of Information and Computer Sciences](http://www.ics.hawaii.edu) at the [University of Hawaii](http://www.hawaii.edu).  Principal developers of WattDepot include: Robert Brewer, Philip Johnson, Andrea Connell, Cam Moore, and Yongwen Xu.

## Legacy versions

This site documents version 3 of WattDepot, which provides a lot of new functionality, but breaks compatibility with previous versions of WattDepot. Version 3 has also not been tested and used in production as much as the previous release. For more information, see the home of the [previous major release of WattDepot](http://csdl.github.io/wattdepot/)
