# Welcome to WattDepot

## What it does

WattDepot is an open source set of services that can be used to:
* Collect electricity and/or other associated environmental data (temperature, humidity, lighting) from meters;
* Store this data in a back-end repository;
* Provide useful querying and retrieval functions for visualization or integration with other applications.

## Who we are

Its development has been sponsored by the [Collaborative Software Development Laboratory](http://csdl.ics.hawaii.edu) in the [Department of Information and Computer Sciences](http://www.ics.hawaii.edu) at the [University of Hawaii](http://www.hawaii.edu).
