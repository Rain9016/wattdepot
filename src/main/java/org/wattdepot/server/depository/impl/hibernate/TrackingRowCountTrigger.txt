Need to initialize the trigger on the measurements table.

BEGIN;
   -- Make sure no rows can be added to measurements until we have finished
   LOCK TABLE measurements IN SHARE ROW EXCLUSIVE MODE;

   create TRIGGER countrows
      AFTER INSERT OR DELETE on measurements
      FOR EACH ROW EXECUTE PROCEDURE count_rows();

   -- Initialise the row count record
   DELETE FROM rowcount WHERE tablename = 'measurements';

   INSERT INTO rowcount (pk, tablename, totalrows)
   VALUES  (1, 'measurements',  (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM measurements));

COMMIT;
