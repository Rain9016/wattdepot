WattDepot models the domain of measurement collection, storage, and analysis through the following conceptual entities.

<h2>Sensors</h2>

Sensors represent the device that measures the physical universe. Sensors have:
<ul>
<li> URIs - A Internet address where collector processes can access their measurements.</li> 
<li> Locations - The location on the earth of the sensor (e.g. Latitude, Longitude, Altitude, Description).</li>
<li> Models A description of the type of sensor, the protocol and version it is using.</li>
<li> Properties - A potentially empty list of properties that describe the individual sensor.</li>
</ul>

Another use for sensors is to create a 'forecast' sensor.  This sensor can make forecast measurements about the future.


<h2>Sensor Groups</h2>

Sensor groups are, simply, groups of sensors. WattDepot uses these groups for aggregation. We can group all the energy sensors in a building into a single group.

<h2>Collectors</h2>

Collectors are processes that contact a Sensor and produce measurements. Collector is a representation of how often to poll a Sensor and the Depository in which to store the measurements. Collectors should use the Collector Process Definition to control their activities.

<h2>Depositories</h2>

Depositories are responsible for storing the measurements made by the Sensors. They have an associated measurement type.

<h2>Measurements</h2>

Measurements are made by Sensors and consist of the sensor that made the measurement, the time the measurement was made, the value of the measurement and the measurement type.

<h2>Measured Values</h2>

Measured values are often interpolated from sensor measurements. There are two primary Measured Values, point values and difference values.

Point values are calculated at a single point in time. If the time corresponds to a measurement then WattDepot returns the measurement's value. If the time is between two measurements WattDepot calculates the linear interpolated value and returns it.

For Difference values, WattDepot gets the value for the start and end points then subtracts the start value from the end value and returns the result.
